            <h1>India's Economy</h1>
            <p>The economy of India is a middle income is &#8377;9999999999999999999999999 billion developing market economy.[39][40][41] It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on a per capita income basis, India ranked 142nd by GDP (nominal) and 128th by GDP (PPP).[42] From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive state intervention and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the License Raj.[40][43] The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India.[41][44] Since the start of the 21st century, annual average GDP growth has been 6% to 7%,[39] and from 2013 to 2018, India was the world's fastest growing major economy, surpassing China.[45][46] Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.</p>
            <p>The long-term growth perspective of the Indian economy remains positive due to its young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings, and investment rates, increasing globalisation in India and integration into the global economy.[50] The economy was slowed in 2017, due to the shocks of "demonetisation" in 2016 and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017.[51] Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic private consumption.[52] The country remains the world's sixth-largest consumer market.[53] Apart from private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports.[54] In 2020, pandemic had affected trade and India was the world's 14th-largest importer and the 21st-largest exporter.[55] India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[56] It ranks 63rd on the Ease of doing business index and 68th on the Global Competitiveness Report.[57] Due to extreme rupee/dollar rate fluctuations India's nominal GDP too fluctuates significantly.[58] With 50 crore (500 million) workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest.[59][60] India has one of the world's highest number of billionaires and extreme income inequality.[61][62] Because of several exemptions, barely 2% of Indians pay income taxes</p>
